# Sui Crypto Analysis - A Python Project

SUI is the native coin of the Sui network, a layer-1 blockchain platform designed for global adoption that utilizes a novel object-centric data model and the Move programming language. The SUI coin has a capped total supply of 10 billion.

Key aspects of the SUI coin and the Sui network include:
*   **Functionality** SUI serves as the network's currency and is used for paying transaction fees (gas fees) and storage. It can be staked to participate in the network's proof-of-stake mechanism. SUI is also a versatile and liquid asset for various applications within the Sui ecosystem.
*   **Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Mechanism:** The Sui network uses a delegated proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism where validators lock up SUI as collateral and earn rewards for processing operations. Users can delegate their SUI to validators and earn rewards.
*   **Tokenomics:** Sui's tokenomics are designed to support the long-term financial needs of Web3. The tokenomics structure includes a vesting schedule to enhance network stability. There were no SUI airdrops to support the launch of the Mainnet network.
*   **Storage Fund:** Sui utilizes a storage fund, which is a cache of SUI that collects fees from on-chain transactions that add data to the chain. The storage fund is used to compensate validators for storage costs, and it also contributes to the deflationary aspect of the network.
*   **Deflationary Aspects** The capped total supply of SUI and the storage fund contribute to the deflationary nature of the network. Increased activity on the network leads to a larger storage fund, which reduces the amount of SUI in circulation.
*   **Validator Rewards** Sui uses a novel approach to reward validators, where all honest validators receive staking rewards based only on the amount of stake they hold, removing randomness from the equation. Each validator on Sui maintains its own staking pool that tracks the amount of stake and compounds rewards over time.
*   **Technology**: Suiâ€™s architecture features low-latency transactions with stable fees, high throughput through horizontal scaling and parallelized execution. The object-oriented design of Sui allows developers to create objects tailored to their needs with inherent network-wide compatibility. Sui uses the Move programming language for its smart contracts, which is designed to be safe and expressive.
*  **Transactions**: Transactions on Sui are executed in parallel, and many transactions can be finalized and settled in less than half a second.
*   **zkLogin**: Sui uses zkLogin to enable users to create and manage accounts using web logins.

The Sui network is maintained by a permissionless set of authorities, similar to validators on other blockchains. It uses a Byzantine consistent broadcast protocol between authorities to ensure safety of operations on assets, while relying on Byzantine agreement for shared objects, governance and check-pointing.

Sui's native token, SUI, is used for staking, paying gas fees, and as a versatile asset within its ecosystem. The network uses a storage fund, a mechanism that adds a deflationary aspect to SUI. Validators play a key role in securing the network by processing transactions and are rewarded in proportion to their stake. The Sui network also supports light clients and bridges to other blockchains.
